# FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures - Non-Certification Projects

This repository contains various non-certification projects and practice exercises completed as part of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** course on FreeCodeCamp. These projects highlight my continued exploration and application of JavaScript in solving algorithmic challenges and implementing data structures.

## Projects Included

- **Project 1**: Array Manipulation Practice
- **Project 2**: Object Oriented Programming Exercises
- **Project 3**: Functional Programming Challenges
- **Project 4**: Algorithm Practice (e.g., sorting algorithms, recursion)
- **Project 5**: Data Structure Implementations (e.g., stacks, queues)

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Functional Programming Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures and Algorithms

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, clone the repository and navigate to the specific project folder. You can execute the JavaScript files using Node.js or open them in your browser's console for testing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudo-kishan267/fcc-JS-NonCert-Projects.git
cd fcc-JS-NonCert-Projects
